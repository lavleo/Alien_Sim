- Code structure met all requirements
- Simulation runs in a codespace with 1000+ entities at 30FPS
- Some of the placement of code would be better (e.g. the process of checking/eating prey should probably also be in the Predator class)
- Code is organized as required
- Advanced features via incubation, speed upgrades for predator as it eats, and "escape ship" for the prey.
- Presentation and report complete; I really enjoyed the "story" applied to the project!

I really love the concept and how different it is from most other projects. Giving a story to the simulation absolutely makes it a bit more fun (even if we cannot see the ship and such).
